Hi Eduonix Team,

I am Piyush Puri, share you the thoughts which i had in my mind during the project, first i had declared the value of balance and pin and store this values  respectively,then i need to print the main output that is ***Welcome To The ATM Simulator*** , so by using simply print command i had done this, after this print the options and get the input from the user and store this input in variable respectively, so all this values perform by their respective statements which i had set for all these. Finally this program run successfully.

Thank you eduonix team.

Regards 
Piyush Puri
